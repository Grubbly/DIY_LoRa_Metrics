# DIY_LoRa_Metrics
A little experiment for measuring the range of a DIY LoRa system

## Overview

I built two LoRa tranceivers and wanted to test the range of the system by placing one tranceiver at my house and the other on my car as I drive around town. Distance is obtained by transmitting the GPS coordinates of my car to the tranceiver at my house. This data is processed to calculate distance and also mapped to produce a nice visual representation of the system's range.


Although both devices are configured to transmit and receive (as their functionality would suggest), I refer to *the device on my car* as the **transmitter** and *the device at my house* as the **receiver**.
